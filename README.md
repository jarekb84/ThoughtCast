# 🎙️ ThoughtCast · Voice → Text, Locally.
> Capture ideas at the speed of thought. Record, transcribe, and transform your voice into text — all offline, all yours.

ThoughtCast is a cross-platform desktop app that captures your spoken ideas and instantly converts them to text using local Whisper transcription.
It’s designed as a high-bandwidth entry point for thought — speak freely, and ThoughtCast transforms your stream of consciousness into usable text for docs, PRDs, or AI workflows.

🧠 Speak → Transcribe → Copy → Create.

Everything runs locally — no cloud services, no external APIs — making it private, fast, and extensible for future integrations like LM Studio or local model post-processing.
